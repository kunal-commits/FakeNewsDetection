# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning

## Description:
This project uses a Machine Learning model (Passive Aggressive Classifier) to detect whether a news article is real or fake. It uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical format.

## Dataset:
The dataset includes two CSV files:
- Fake.csv: Fake news articles
- True.csv: Real news articles
(Source: Kaggle)

## Tech Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TfidfVectorizer

## Accuracy:
Achieved over 90% accuracy on test data.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Data preprocessing
- Text classification (NLP)
- Model training and evaluation
